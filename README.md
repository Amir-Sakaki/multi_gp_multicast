# Requirements to run

In order to run successfully the project requirements are:

1. Python 3.6
2. Pythun pulp library
2. Pythun networkx library
2. Pythun numpy library
2. CBC solver

# config.json

inside folder 'etc' there is a json file called *'config.json'* which includes given configuration for the Project. The values are set to those indicted by the Professor Leonardi, however it is possible to edit


# main.py
In order to run the Project, simply run *'main.py'*. To perform modifications of input parameters, refer to *'config.json'* file.

     
# Description
1. Graph generation
   - The base of the problem which is a random graph showing nodes and edges with corresponding costs are created in *'Matrix_Definition.py'* using networkx library and is located inside *simulator* folder
   - Group generation. Set of a source and some destinations is called a group. This is done in *'group_generator.py'* inside *simulator* folder

## Run the code:
Run the code by writing in the terminal
```
python3 main.py
```
and enjoy...


## Report

For the final report you can use both Word or Latex.
I strongly suggest the second one because it is more suited to deal with equations, models, graphs, etc.
A really nice website that enables you to work together and deals with all the package issues of latex is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). In the folder *report* you have a latex template that you can directly load on overleaf.
A useful link for creating latex table is [here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/latex_tables)
The folder report contains a latex template with some examples.


## Text Editor

In order write good code you need a good editor. The best one that I recomend are:

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) free;
1. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) free for non commercial usage;
1. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) free for students.
